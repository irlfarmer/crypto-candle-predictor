# Improved Candlestick Prediction System

## 1. Model Improvements

### Enhanced Feature Engineering
- Added comprehensive technical indicators:
  - Price changes and ranges
  - Candlestick shadows analysis
  - Multiple timeframe volatility (10, 20, 30 periods)
  - Multiple timeframe trends and trend strength
  - Volume analysis with moving averages
  - Price momentum indicators
- Implemented safety checks for numerical stability
- Added value clipping to prevent extreme outliers
- Improved handling of NaN and infinity values

### Improved Model Architecture
- Switched to functional API for better flexibility
- Implemented a deeper LSTM network:
  - 4 LSTM layers (256 → 128 → 64 → 32 units)
  - Batch normalization after each layer
  - Dropout (0.3) for regularization
  - Skip connections through dense layers
- Mixed precision training for better performance
- Memory optimization techniques

### Enhanced Loss Function
- Combined multiple loss components:
  - Base MSE loss for accuracy
  - Direction loss with 15x weight
  - High-low relationship penalties
  - Candlestick structure enforcement
- Better trend direction prediction emphasis

### Robust Training Process
- Implemented time series cross-validation:
  - Designed for 5 sequential folds with expanding window
  - Each fold increases training window by 6 months
  - Initial training window: 1 year of data
  - Validation window: 3 months for each fold
  - No data leakage between folds
  - Current Implementation Status:
    - Fold 1: Best val_loss 16.24992 (Epoch 11)
    - Fold 2: Best val_loss 17.32778 (Epoch 1)
    - Fold 3: Best val_loss 16.80249 (Epoch 1)
    - Fold 4: Best val_loss 15.48756 (Epoch 7)
    - Fold 5: Best val_loss 16.47015 (Epoch 4)
  - Training interrupted due to optimizer configuration issue
  - Need to fix: Learning rate schedule configuration
- Added comprehensive callbacks:
  - Early stopping with patience
  - Model checkpointing (saving best models)
  - Training history logging
  - Learning rate reduction (needs reconfiguration)
- Enhanced error handling and recovery
- Progress tracking and monitoring

### Data Processing Improvements
- Separate scalers for price, volume, and other features
- Better handling of missing values and infinities
- Improved sequence creation process
- Memory-efficient data handling
- Proper handling of unclosed candles
